His carved face shifts from playful to menacing, eyes flickering with a greenish glow that illuminates the misty darkness. Fog swirls along the forest floor, and gnarled trees, adorned with glowing jack-o'-lanterns, stand like skeletal sentries around him. His deep, echoing laughter fills the air as his minions flit about, ready to fulfill his every dark command. Here, the Pumpkin King embodies the spirit of Halloween itself, both guardian and terror of his haunted realm.")}}
